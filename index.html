              Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the
              subject material? All you've really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over, the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

  Hi! It's much better, keep going!
  1. Semantics is good
  2. BEM is almost perfect
  3. Absolute positioning is nice

  These important issues should be fixed:
  1. BEM issues should be fixed. Modifiers can't be used without modified elements, use this structure:
    block block_modifier_value
    block__element block__element_modifier_value
  It means that we should use at least two classes when there is a modifier
  2. All properties and classes from the brief should be added, some should be replaced or fixed
  3. To group items ul tag should be used

  Good luck!
